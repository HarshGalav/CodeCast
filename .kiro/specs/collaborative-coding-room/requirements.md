# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Collaborative Coding Room is a web application that enables multiple users to join virtual rooms and collaboratively edit C++ code in real-time. The application provides a secure environment for code compilation and execution using Docker containers, with comprehensive safety measures to prevent abuse. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, it offers a modern, responsive interface with Monaco Editor for code editing and Yjs for real-time synchronization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a unique coding room, so that I can invite others to collaborate on C++ code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to create a room THEN the system SHALL generate a unique room key
2. WHEN a room is created THEN the system SHALL store room metadata in PostgreSQL database
3. WHEN a room is created THEN the system SHALL initialize an empty code document with Yjs
4. WHEN a room is created THEN the system SHALL return the room key to the creator
5. IF a room creation fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to join an existing coding room using a room key, so that I can collaborate with others on their code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a valid room key THEN the system SHALL allow them to join the room
2. WHEN a user joins a room THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection for real-time sync
3. WHEN a user joins a room THEN the system SHALL load the current code state from Yjs document
4. IF a room key is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL return an error message
5. WHEN a user joins a room THEN the system SHALL notify other participants of the new user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to edit code collaboratively in real-time, so that multiple people can work on the same codebase simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the Monaco Editor THEN the changes SHALL be synchronized in real-time using Yjs
2. WHEN multiple users edit simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle conflict resolution automatically
3. WHEN a user makes changes THEN other users SHALL see the changes within 100ms
4. WHEN a user's cursor moves THEN other users SHALL see cursor position updates
5. WHEN a user selects text THEN other users SHALL see the selection highlights
6. IF the WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to compile and run C++ code securely, so that I can test my collaborative code without security risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests code compilation THEN the system SHALL queue the job in a secure processing queue
2. WHEN a compile job is processed THEN the system SHALL execute it in an isolated Docker container
3. WHEN code is compiled THEN the system SHALL use g++ compiler with appropriate flags
4. WHEN code is executed THEN the system SHALL enforce strict resource limits (CPU, memory, time)
5. WHEN code execution completes THEN the system SHALL return stdout, stderr, and exit code
6. IF code execution exceeds time limits THEN the system SHALL terminate the process and return timeout error
7. IF code execution exceeds memory limits THEN the system SHALL terminate the process and return memory error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the code execution environment to be completely isolated, so that malicious code cannot harm the host system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Docker container is created THEN the system SHALL use --net=none to disable network access
2. WHEN a Docker container is created THEN the system SHALL set memory limits to prevent memory bombs
3. WHEN a Docker container is created THEN the system SHALL set CPU limits to prevent CPU exhaustion
4. WHEN a Docker container is created THEN the system SHALL set --pids-limit to prevent fork bombs
5. WHEN a Docker container is created THEN the system SHALL use --no-new-privileges flag
6. WHEN a Docker container is created THEN the system SHALL run as non-root user
7. WHEN code execution completes THEN the system SHALL destroy the container immediately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want room data to persist across sessions, so that I can return to my collaborative work later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN room data changes THEN the system SHALL store snapshots in PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN a user rejoins a room THEN the system SHALL restore the latest code state
3. WHEN a room is inactive for 24 hours THEN the system SHALL archive the room data
4. WHEN room metadata is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trail
5. IF database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without data loss

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive and intuitive interface, so that I can focus on coding rather than fighting with the UI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean, modern interface using TailwindCSS
2. WHEN using Monaco Editor THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting for C++
3. WHEN using Monaco Editor THEN the system SHALL provide code completion and error detection
4. WHEN the interface is accessed on mobile THEN the system SHALL adapt to smaller screen sizes
5. WHEN users are collaborating THEN the system SHALL show participant cursors with different colors
6. WHEN compilation results are available THEN the system SHALL display them in a dedicated output panel

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see real-time feedback about compilation and execution, so that I can quickly iterate on my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code compilation starts THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
2. WHEN compilation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display success message
3. WHEN compilation fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages with line numbers
4. WHEN code execution produces output THEN the system SHALL stream results in real-time
5. WHEN multiple compile requests are made THEN the system SHALL queue them appropriately
6. IF compilation takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show progress updates

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the application to be scalable and deployable on cloud platforms, so that it can handle varying loads efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed on AWS/GCP THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling of worker processes
2. WHEN database load increases THEN the system SHALL support read replicas for better performance
3. WHEN Docker container execution load increases THEN the system SHALL distribute jobs across multiple worker nodes
4. WHEN WebSocket connections increase THEN the system SHALL support load balancing across multiple instances
5. WHEN persistent storage is needed THEN the system SHALL use managed database services
6. IF a worker node fails THEN the system SHALL redistribute jobs to healthy nodes

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want assurance that the application follows security best practices, so that my code and the system remain safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling user input THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
3. WHEN establishing WebSocket connections THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication
4. WHEN handling file operations THEN the system SHALL prevent path traversal attacks
5. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL not log sensitive information
6. WHEN rate limiting is needed THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate throttling mechanisms
